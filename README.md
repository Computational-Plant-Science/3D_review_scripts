scripts for comparison 3D reconstruction pipelines

We compared commonly used open-source methods on a test panel of twelve contrasting maize genotypes grown in real field conditions. These methods include COLMAP [1], VisualSFM [2], OpenMVG [3], Meshroom [4] and Multi-View Environment [5]. Comparisons of 3D point cloud model density, number of points, and computation time is performed.
